#  Secure Container Deployment Hackathon

This repository is used to support the 2-day Secure Container Deployment hackathon. Groups of people will work together in teams to work through challenges. Challenges are open-ended with different pathways to success and different teams may come up with different solutions.

If you are interested in having this event run at your organization :office:, please reach out to your friendly team :trollface: at Palo Alto Networks for details.

Internal and external developers are constantly updating applications and recently there have been several critical issues related to vulnerable container deployments.
